3. Fill in the Gaps

The foundation for our building is slowly collapsing. We need to reinforce it by filling in the gaps! Our foundation is made up of a bunch of different integers, with values that could still be filled in between. Your job is to figure out which values can be filled in between the existing ones.  



Inputs

1. Size of the integer array

The value is > 0.

2. Elements of the integer array

The elements are in ascending order and each element is within the range: 0 <= n <= 2,147,483,647



Sample Output

Enter the size: 5
Enter the elements: 1 3 4 7 9
Gaps = 2 5 6 8


Program:

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int n, a[n];
    
    printf("Enter the size: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    
    printf("Enter the elements: ");
    
    for(int i=0; i< n; i++)
        scanf("%d", &a[i]);
        printf("Gaps = ");
    
    for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++)
    {
        for(int j=a[i]+1; j<a[i+1]; j++)
        {
            printf("%d ", j);
        }
    }
    
}
