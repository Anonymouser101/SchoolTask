4. Finding Cody

Have you seen Cody?

Well, heâ€™s not actually lost, you see, but I just wanted to make a program that would let me find "Cody" among the given letters of a user in case he really does go missing.

So, care to help me with it?



Inputs

1. The four characters



Sample Output

Enter the first character: o
Enter the second character: C
Enter the third character: d
Enter the fourth character: Y
I found you!


Program:

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char letter[4];
    int c=0, o=0, d=0, y=0; 

    printf("Enter the first character: ");
    scanf(" %c", &letter[0]);
    printf("Enter the second character: ");
    scanf(" %c", &letter[1]);
    printf("Enter the third character: ");
    scanf(" %c", &letter[2]);
    printf("Enter the fourth character: ");
    scanf(" %c", &letter[3]); 

    for(int i=0; i<4; i++){
        if(letter[i] == 'c' || letter[i] == 'C')
            c=1;
        if(letter[i] == 'o' || letter[i] == 'O')
            o=1;
        if(letter[i] == 'd' || letter[i] == 'D')
            d=1;
        if(letter[i] == 'y' || letter[i] == 'Y')
            y=1;
    }
    if(c==1 && o==1 && d==1 && y==1){
            printf("I found you!");
    }else{
        printf("Cody is missing");
    }
}
